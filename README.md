## Chemical process optimization

_This code is for optimizing the temperature at which the concentration of a chemical species B is maximized in a series of chemical reactions._

1. __Importing Libraries__:
    - `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting graphs.
    - `numpy` for numerical operations.
    - `math` for mathematical functions.
    - `solve_ivp` from `scipy.integrate` for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
    - `minimize_scalar` from `scipy.optimize` for scalar function minimization.

2. __Defining Functions__:
    - `ode(t, x, T)`: Defines the system of ODEs representing the reaction rates of species A, B, and C as functions of time t, concentrations x, and temperature T.
    - `k(T)`: Calculates the rate constants k1 and k2 based on the temperature T.
    - `objective(T, t_bound, x0)`: Defines the objective function to be minimized. It solves the ODEs over a time span t_bound with initial concentrations x0 and returns the negative concentration of B at the end of the time span (to maximize B).

3. __Setting Initial Conditions__:
    - `t_bound`: Defines the start and end times for the reaction.
    - `tspan`: Creates a time interval between the start and end times.
    - `x0`: Sets the initial concentrations of species A, B, and C.

4. __Optimization__:
    Uses minimize_scalar to find the temperature T that maximizes the concentration of B by minimizing the negative concentration of B.

5. __Solving ODEs at Optimum Temperature__:
    - Solves the ODEs using the optimal temperature T_final.
    - Extracts the time intervals and concentrations of A, B, and C over time.

6. __Output and Plotting__:
    - Prints the optimal temperature and the maximum concentration of B.
    - Plots the concentrations of A, B, and C over time.

_The goal of this code is to determine the temperature at which the concentration of species B is maximized in a series reaction and visualize the concentration profiles of A, B, and C over time._
